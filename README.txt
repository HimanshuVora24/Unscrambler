How to use: 

1. Compile and run unscramble.java

2. Upon running, the program will prompt you to provide it with letters, all combined as a single words. 
- Example: ehlol 
    - ehlol will return "hello" and "holle" 


Things to improve on: 

1. Duplicate words exist in this list due to uppercase alternatives. 
2. Improve the word list overall. This list contains several uncommon words, so it may be better to exclude those from 
the list.
